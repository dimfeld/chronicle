She is a Rough Collie, a breed of dog known for its intelligence, loyalty, and protective nature.\n\nIn the beginning, Lassie was a real-life Rough Collie named Pal, played by a male dog named Rudd Weatherwax, who starred in the 1943 film \"Lassie Come-Home.\" The story was written by Eric Knight and tells the tale of a young boy who buys a smooth collie puppy from a street vendor and later loses him. The novel was a huge success and was adapted into several films, television shows, and even a theme park attraction.\n\nOver time, Lassie has become a symbol of loyalty, courage, and faithfulness. She is often depicted as a female dog, although the original Pal, who played Lassie in the films, was a male. The character has been portrayed by several dogs over the years, with the most well-known being Pal, Sue, and Baby.\n\nLassie has appeared in numerous films, television shows, and books throughout the years.
